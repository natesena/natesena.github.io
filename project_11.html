                <p>As a big music lover I have been going to regular concerts for quite some time. COnsidering all the effort it takes to plan some of these trips, it makes sense that many often spend time about their outfits/costumes and other items. For me, as totems were not allowed and the festival weather was set to be near 100 degrees, I figured there could be nothing better than a festive fan.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I opted for a nylon fabric that would be light and easy to work with. I was happy with the pattern and while slightly off the typical Coachella aesthetic, I found that the bright colors matched the stages and artwork even better.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The wooden pieces were cut from 1/8" MDF, and handled decently, but I recommend a Hardwood as one piece did break in my backpack.  The inscription "Coachella 2016" was detailed onto each piece with a vector etch. The nylon was rubber glued onto each piece and all the pieces were connected using a nut and bolt.</p>
