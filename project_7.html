                <h3>Coin Sorter</h3>
                <h4>The Beginning of Interference fits</h4>
                <p>As one of my first projects in my MEAM class, I was tasked with creating a design implementing interference fits, otherwise known as press fits. We had to use three different materials, of which the available types were acrylic and MDF in 1/8" and 1/4" sheets. Having just transferred into the class and being thrown into the line of fire, I did not yet feel capable of taking on a huge project, but wanted to make something interesting noentheless. A practical guy myself, I went for utility over art and chose a coin sorter. This first project ended up teaching me a lot about being a decent modeler right off the bat.</p>
                <h4>Modeling</h4>
                <p>One of the problems I found with modeling interference fits is that you can't truly tell if things will stick together. Even in assembly mode, when tolerances look like everything is a tight fit, you can not be sure unless you make your parts and test them out. However, I can be honest that I was not this leel of sage quite yet. I began as the type who modeled individual pieces, skipped the assembly, and anufactured my parts to check for fit. This is extremely speedy, but in the real world this can be extremely costly when one sheet of MDF can turn into three. Considering more costly materials for more professional products, professional mistakes can be extremely costly. When at all possible, I have learned to at a bare minimum try to assemble pieces beforehand, to minimize errors. Errors many times are unavoidable, but this practice I feel will payoff in the long run.</p>
                <h4>Design Changes</h4>
                <p>I made a couple critical errors when designing this with functionality in mind. The first was that there is no loading bay for the coins. I made a small circular area for this, but should have made it much larger. Additionally, it would have been neat to have the coins slide towards their holes at an incline to speed things up, making the process more automatic. The last recommendation I would have given myself is to make more struts to encapsulate the coins. Unfortunately, I only put two on each edge of the coin, which does nothing to prevent them from sliding out of alignment. A better feature would have added another strut and an easy way to fit in the coined bags which banks accept.</p>
