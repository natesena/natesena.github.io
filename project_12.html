                <p>With virtual reality set to make waves in 2017, it seems ironic that there is such little VR content out there, nonetheless an easy way to produce it. With LG, Samsung, and Ricoh making portable cameras to change this, I thought they could be one uped with better functionality. Considering how one I am sure to have my phone on me regardless of if I have remembered to bring my gear 360, I decided to blend the two. One, the thing I never forget, the brains and viewing device of the VR cam, and two, the camera itself blended into a case.</p>
                <p>I came up with the idea back in June while in Kolkata with my friend Karan. We were discussing various products we would like to make and I brought up a more portable VR camera built into a phone case. Karan added a bit about modularity and I added more storage, possibly a built in battery considering the thickness the camera would require.</p>

                <p>I think it would make sense to make this case in 3-4 Pieces for upgradeability and maintenance. I think the camera bit would consist of potentially its own piece along with a cover, then a mid section and bottom section. The middle section could contain a replaceable battery and have in line electrical contacts. The bottom would have the current standard MFI base for the Iphone, while a separate Android version might need completely different retooling.</p>
                <p>Back to the camera and cover, the cover could have a few different features. For one, I did not really want the cover to ever become disattached. I often lose things and a cover protecting special lenses should not be easily broken or lost. I figure it can be attached by either a small pivoting bracket or simply a tiny loop. <br>I drew out two separate versions of the top. On the left is a pivoting clamshell which can hang over fingers easily while shooting, but might come apart in a pocket without a good interference fit or magnets. The version on the right pops off the top and secures on the bottom for shooting, much like a Crayola marker.</p>
